            <h1 id="article-title">GIVING UP HOCKEY: WRITING AS IF I WERE MY BROTHER.</h1>
            <p id="article-content">
                In my family, being a Potocsky son means being a hockey player. I come from a long line of hockey 
                fanatics. My dad grew up playing Triple A hockey alongside teammates that eventually went to the NHL. 
                My uncle, cousins, and grandpa all played the game as they were growing up as well. 
                Even now, at 76 years old, my grandpa’s love for the sport has not faded as he is a 
                season-ticket holder for the Detroit Redwings (I hate to tell him that they are not that good anymore, but that’s not the point). 
                Point is, it is pretty much expected of us to grow up holding a stick and puck.<br><br>
                It seemed unbearable to imagine a life without hockey; to be frank, quitting never even entered my mind. 
                It was embedded into my brain that I would be just as dedicated as my father was to the sport. 
                In fact, it felt as though my entire relationship with my dad depended on my love for the game; 
                what I could work on in a game, what I was doing well with, and what was going on currently in the National Hockey 
                League made up most of what we talked about. My dad coached all of my teams growing up. 
                He was my toughest critic but also biggest supporter. I was afraid that if I ever quit the game that I would not be able to relate to him anymore.<br><br>
                When I first started playing, I really enjoyed the game. I was a quick learner and people seemed to notice my speed and intelligence with the puck. I obtained a leadership role and was the captain of my team from sixth grade to tenth.<br><br>
                My skills started to diminish when I got my fourth concussion. 
                The problem was that my love for the game remained stagnant the whole time. 
                It was frustrating that I was getting worse on the ice even though I was motivated just as much as I was when I was healthy. 
                My doctors warned me that if I kept getting concussions that my entire brain chemistry would change; I did not believe them. Looking back, I was oblivious- totally blinded by my passion for the sport.<br><br>
                It was not until my fifth concussion that made me reevaluate my entire life plan. 
                I cannot remember anything past getting slammed extremely hard. 
                My head was thrown onto the boards causing me to drop to the ground where my head proceeded to take another strike to the hard, ice floor. 
                The only thing that I can imagine comparing the pain that overtook my body to is being rammed by a truck. After a split-second of excruciating pain, I blacked out. 
                All I know is that my mom was shrieking in the crowd as she watched her son unable to move through the glass. Even my dad knew that my hockey career needed to end.<br><br>
                The decision was mine whether or not I wanted to continue playing hockey. Of course, I still wanted to play. However, I also wanted a life beyond the sport. I want to go to college and get a job that I love. I want a family. If I kept playing hockey, I would be risking more injuries to my brain and my brain is my body’s powerhouse. Without it working properly, I could not excel at what I aim to do in life. Ultimately, 
                I put my aspirations above my desire to play hockey- the sport so near and dear to my family that it became a part of my identity. I was afraid to lose that part of me, but I would lose more if I kept playing.<br><br>
                It has been a little over two years post-hockey. I miss it with every ounce in my body, but I realized that even when I am not playing, it is still a part of who I am. The sport taught me teamwork. 
                It taught me leadership, integrity, and how to own up for my mistakes. 
                Most of all, it taught me how to be the best person that I can be on and off of the ice.<br><br>
                With regards to my dad, I discovered that playing hockey didn’t dictate the “plays” of our relationship. I am no less of a Potocsky because I no longer play the sport. 
                My dad’s relationship with me goes beyond sticks and pucks. 
                It is about him teaching me to be a good person. It is about us blasting 80s music as we eat burgers and talk about life. Him coaching me hockey has helped mold me into the person that I am today, but even more I am who I am thanks to him coaching me on life. And that life-coaching will stay with me forever.<br><br>
                Not everything in life goes to plan. I have given up on aiming for perfection and have begun to focus on cherishing the little things in life. The unexpected happens, but that is what makes life interesting.<br><br>
