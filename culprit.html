            <h1 id="article-title">OUR PLANET IS DYING: CAN FASHION BE A CULPRIT IN THIS DISASTER?</h1>
            <p id="article-content">
                “The Amazon is burning”; “The Coral Reef is dying”; “We only have twelve years to limit the detrimental 
                effects of the climate change catastrophe”. Nearly any time that I look at my Twitter feed, 
                I will come across some sort of post similar to those above preaching about environmental disasters. It is no secret that our world’s climate is ever-changing and that the effects of 
                global warming are calamitous. Fashion enterprises continuously aim to produce “the next new thing”. However, this constant pursuit of developing 
                enticing products for customers has left a huge carbon footprint in our society. 
                A question of sustainability has been brought up by many consumers. 
                Buyers desire products that are both beautiful and made in a sustainable way. 
                Going into the new year, more and more companies are putting sustainability on the forefront and discovering methods to create a successful business in the most environmentally-friendly way possible. <br><br>
                There has been a new wave overwhelming the fashion industry. 
                As more and more consumers are becoming aware of fashion’s negative impact on our Earth, 
                conversations are flooding the worksphere. In response to these conversations, fashion designers and producers have begun to change the way that their line is made and represented. 
                For starters, in August, a multitude of brands signed a “Fashion Pact” run by French luxury brand Kering. Labels made commitments to decrease their carbon footprints and ultimately agreed 
                to measure the possible biodiversity impacts of a possible plan before carrying it out.<br><br>
                Kering has edited their manufacturing process in order to reduce environmental impact. They decided to remove heavy metals from their factory production to allow clean water to pass
                out of their facility. Designer Gabriela Hearst has transformed her brand to use biodegradable packaging and fabric remnants from high-end textile mills to limit waste. Moreover, at Milan Fashion Week, 
                Gucci announced that the company was to become entirely carbon neutral. 
                With regards to past emissions that they cannot fix, Gucci is paying the environment back by partnering with Redd+: “a UN project to reduce emissions from deforestation in Peru, Kenya, Indonesia and Cambodia” (Vogue).<br><br>
                Popular teen brand H&M has reconstructed their business model to optimize both productivity and sustainability. 
                The company is testing out a rental program in which members of H&M’s loyalty program can rent clothing for $37 per week. 
                The goal of this method is to limit both waste and mass production’s ill effects. 
                After falling under public scrutiny for undertaking in consequential fast-fashion production methods, H&M released a statement in which they claimed to “reach the point that its greenhouse gas emissions go negative by 2040”. 
                If the enterprise meets this goal, then they will offset more emissions than they actually produce. <br><br>
                According to Refinery29, “A United Nations report found that the fashion industry is responsible for up to 20% of global wastewater and 10% of global carbon emissions, more than all international flights and shipping.” 
                With that being said, both fashionistas and fashion designers must tackle the best way to make a company as sustainable as possible. It has to come to the point that businesses must put the health of our planet over their profits. 
                While the process to convert to an eco-friendly brand is difficult, little changes can go a long way. If brands must redesign their production process and values, then so be it. Our planet is dying and it is up to our generation and workers to fix it.<br><br>
